# Limbsure-Capstone
Limbsure, a year-long Capstone project by four high school students, aims to revolutionize the prosthetic arm industry by addressing accessibility and functionality limitations.
The project's main goals are to reduce the high cost of prosthetic arms, make them affordable, and improve their functionality for practical daily use.
